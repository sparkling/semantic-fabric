# semantic-fabric coding harness

Private, development-only control plane for verified repository changes. It
coordinates native Codex/ChatGPT and Claude Code subscriptions, but direct
repository evaluators decide whether a candidate passes.

The package has no CLI, MCP server, publication path, commit/push authority, or
evolution command. It returns evidence and a patch to an explicit integration
owner.

## Local verification

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
```

CI tests use fake model processes and make no provider calls. Runtime model
execution requires successful native subscription preflights. Provider API
keys, ambient proxy variables, base-URL overrides, OpenRouter, and Requesty are
rejected. The controller injects only a loopback CONNECT endpoint backed by its
exact-origin Unix-socket broker.

## Transaction

```text
frozen baseline + evaluator worktrees
  → distinct-host architecture and bounded critique
  → implementation
  → exact-path patch admission
  → clean candidate apply and offline build
  → public + independent + regression verification in parallel
  → independent Codex and Claude reviews
  → protected-input check and digest-chained receipt
  → receipt-bound seven-dimension programme envelope
```

Every repair resets the candidate and repeats admission, build, all verifier
lanes, and both reviews. Candidate commands require an OS network namespace;
dependency installation is a separate registry-pinned stage. Missing isolation
or either native host fails closed.

Native model execution uses independently enforced exact-origin, filesystem, and
resource boundaries. The trusted runtime exposes only a Git-masked candidate
snapshot, private output channel, empty private home, copied credential
capability, and one broker socket; it hides the controller, evaluator, verifier,
common Git object store, and other host paths. A systemd cgroup-v2 transient unit
enforces CPU, memory, PID, file-size, descriptor, and runtime ceilings. Timeout,
cancellation, or output overflow stops and verifies the exact unit before a
result can be accepted, and execution failure revokes active broker sessions.

## Main modules

- `kernel.ts` composes the real `HarnessKernel`, `AlgorithmRouter`,
  `VerifierRegistry`, `PolicyGate`, persistent routed pool, critique, consensus,
  and memory hooks.
- `candidate.ts`, `git-worktrees.ts`, and `repository-operations.ts` enforce the
  patched-candidate transaction and identity checks.
- `native-process.ts`, `network.ts`, and `models/` implement bounded native
  execution, first-party-only transport, routing, retry, breakers, and review
  independence.
- `acceptance-task.ts`, `contracts.ts`, `policy.ts`, `evidence.ts`, and
  `receipts.ts` validate schema-v2 exact-reference and schema-v3 verifier-only
  tasks, Ruflo, Agentic-QE, protected-input, and receipt boundaries. Objective,
  invariants, exclusions, route metadata, commands, generated outputs, QE
  profiles, and oracle mode are protected task data, not controller literals.
- `issue-8-programme-envelope.ts` binds the project-owned acceptance score to
  the frozen schema-v4 issue-8 receipt and makes a rejected score a non-zero
  launcher result.
- `programme-envelope.ts`, `programme-policy-v5.ts`,
  `programme-gate-contract-v1.ts`, and `programme-task-runtime-v1.ts` provide the
  dormant schema-v5 dispatch and externally anchored replay-policy foundation.
  V5 remains fail-closed until its evaluator, envelope and launcher emitter are
  implemented and independently verified.
- `metaharness-diagnostics.ts` parses the protected native Ruflo score snapshot;
  its exact Git blob digest must match the candidate receipt.
- `.harness/manifest.json` is the canonical tracked control-plane manifest and
  identifies the repository's actual `.mcp.json` coordination surface.

The first acceptance definition lives in `config/issue-8-acceptance.json`. The
contract parser also accepts non-issue work-item identifiers, but the attested
launcher still selects only this fixture and its LCOV/SAST collector. A second
task is not executable until manifest-bound task selection and the declared QE
profiles have concrete collectors. The task is not an evolution suite or a
promotion signal. Darwin/GEPA remains disabled until five training tasks and
five sealed holdouts satisfy the independent evaluator gate.

## Retrieval flywheel boundary

Ruflo's retrieval-policy flywheel is governed outside the candidate transaction.
The project tracks a 48-task, hash-pinned candidate relevance anchor with
balanced deterministic halves, and the harness protects those files, the opt-in
settings, and inherited active-policy pointers. The candidate is not approved
for activation until maintainers review its labels and calibrate them against a
live retrieval baseline. Background tuning is disabled in tracked configuration;
the 2026-08-27 operational check also found no opt-in variables or `harness`
worker in the live daemon, which must be rechecked after each restart.

The explicit Ruflo evaluation path is model-call-free, local, and
evaluation-only. It currently no-ops because the flywheel-visible neural store
has no eligible patterns; legacy counters and ReasoningBank data are a different
store. Eight owner-visible records, four harvestable records, and a pinned
non-fallback embedding provider are only the threshold to begin evaluation, not
production readiness. If a future trial emits a signed receipt, replay verifies
receipt integrity, lineage, the gate fingerprint, and the gate decision over
sealed scores. Replay does not re-run retrieval. The separate daemon generation
path is not approved until it uses the same confirmed promotion transaction.
Production receipts will also require durable retention outside the ignored
local state directories.
