# Join-onto-path composition: path branches as alias-preserving derived tables

## Implementation status (2026-07-19, same day)

**Accepted, implemented, adversarially refuted.** Raw-SQL spike passed both
dialects before implementation. All test-contract cells green vs the spareval
oracle, including the mandatory `!p` duplicate-multiplicity bag fixture (4 rows
— dedup would have halved it) and the GROUP-BY-over-joined-path open question
(**works** via ordinary single-branch SQL aggregation — locked green, no
boundary needed). Three pre-existing sound-501 pins in `differential_tree`
lifted for free by the same conversion (path-as-OPTIONAL right/left,
path-left + SubPlan-OPTIONAL-right — the last hand-re-derived independently).
A dedicated adversarial refute pass **SURVIVED all 8 attack surfaces** with
executed evidence (18 permanent regression locks in
`adversarial_adr0033_refute.rs`), including the slice-drop suspicion (refuted
structurally: `Branch.path` and `Branch.limit` are mutually exclusive by
construction — slices always route through `lower_as_subplan`'s pre-existing
guard) and cascade interactions (every core-rewriting pass destructures
`LogicalSource::Table` and skips Query-sourced scans by construction).
Findings routed elsewhere: `hop_sql` NULL-poisoning over nullable columns
(pre-existing, standalone paths too) and the tree resolver dropping GRAPH
constraints entirely (pre-existing, all pattern kinds) — both to the F4
correctness wave; FILTER-on-path-endpoint remains the pre-existing generic
template-var FILTER boundary, unchanged.

**Update (2026-07-19, Run 4 A2) — no longer tree-only.** The flat engine now
runs the SAME `convert_path_branches` pre-conversion at its own
`GraphPattern::Join` arm (`unfold.rs`) before `join_branches` — one shared
conversion, not a second implementation (`convert_path_branches` widened to
`pub(crate)`). Every "tree-only lift" phrasing in this ADR is superseded on
that point: joined-path shapes now answer on BOTH engines, restoring the flat
engine as the `=_bag` oracle over these shapes (`differential_paths.rs::
closure_joined_with_class_pattern_now_matches_oracle_on_both_engines`,
`differential_star.rs::star_pattern_at_property_path_endpoint_now_answers_on_
both_engines`, and the `!p` multiplicity fixture asserted on flat too — 4
rows, dedup would halve it). Same wave: wrong-graph paths return graceful
EMPTY instead of a sound 501 (`resolve_pred_hop` two-pass restructure +
`empty_hop`'s statically-empty derived table, `path.rs`), lifting the
adversarial suite's named-graph 501 pin to an oracle-checked 0-row answer.

## Context and Problem Statement

Any `GraphPattern::Path` joined with anything 501s today — path-shape-agnostic,
both engines, pinned by `differential_paths.rs::closure_joined_with_class_
pattern_hits_the_identical_general_boundary_on_both_engines` and inherited by
RDF-star patterns at path endpoints (`ADR-0032` D6). The literal mechanism: a
path-carrying `Branch` (`core: []`, `path: Some(PathClosure)`) is emitted by
`emit_path_branch` as one self-contained `WITH [RECURSIVE] … SELECT` statement
via an unconditional early return in `emit_branch_with` — it structurally
cannot also carry a join. `unfold::merge` (which the tree's `InnerJoin` arm
calls verbatim — one code path, not two) rejects path-presence before any
unification.

`ADR-0025` item 4's "path-as-derived-table, ~800 lines, M2 milestone" estimate
attached to a *different, harder* problem (multi-branch UNION-pooled
aggregation over paths — sidestepped at the time via `rust_group` routing).
The plain join case was never actually designed until now. Prior art in-tree:
`SqlCond::PathExists` (ADR-0025 gap 1) already proves the WITH-prelude works
nested inside a parenthesized subquery; `lower_as_subplan` proves derived-table
joins generally.

## Decision Outcome

**Convert a path-carrying branch, at the two tree join sites, into an ordinary
branch whose `core` holds one `Scan` with `LogicalSource::Query(<self-contained
path SQL>)` — keeping the outer scan alias identical to `PathClosure.alias`.**

* A new `emit::path_as_derived_table_sql(pc, cte_alias, dialect, catalog)`
  (~15 lines) reuses the proven `path_with_prelude` verbatim with a *fresh
  internal* CTE alias, wrapping it as
  `WITH … SELECT sf_s, sf_o FROM t{cte_alias}`.
* A new `lower::convert_path_branches` (~25–40 lines) takes `b.path`, pushes
  `Scan { alias: pc.alias, source: LogicalSource::Query(sql) }` onto `b.core`.
  Because the **outer alias is unchanged**, every pre-existing
  `TermDef::Derived{Column("sf_s"/"sf_o"), pc.alias}` reference in the
  enclosing `Construction.subst` / conditions resolves to the derived table's
  identically-named output columns — **zero cross-tree rewriting**.
* Call sites, both in `iq/lower.rs`, tree-only: the `IqNode::InnerJoin` arm
  (safe unconditionally — normalize collapses 1-child joins, so standalone
  paths never pass through it and keep today's top-level-`WITH` SQL shape) and
  the `IqNode::LeftJoin` arm (left operand always; right operand *before* the
  `is_single_subplan_branch` check, after which a bare-path right side falls
  naturally into `build_left_join`'s single-scan fast path — gaining OPTIONAL
  inner-FILTER support for free).
* The flat engine's path guards (`merge`, `minus_branches`, `lower_exists`,
  `leftjoin.rs`) stay **unchanged** — a tree-exceeds-flat lift, precedented by
  ADR-0025 gap 3. `SqlCond::PathExists` stays live for the sole-path-in-EXISTS
  case (the conversion fires only inside genuine multi-child joins).

### Rejected alternative: `SubPlanJoin`-based wrapping

Two reasons, both structural. (1) Post-normalize, `lift_inner_join` has already
hoisted variable bindings into one enclosing `Construction`, so the SPARQL
variable names `lower_as_subplan`'s positional remap machinery needs are gone
at the point of wrapping. (2) A real emission-order hazard: `render_from`'s
core-less path renders all `.opts` before any `.subplan_joins` regardless of
insertion order — a path-as-SubPlan followed by an ordinary OPTIONAL
correlating on the path's output would emit a `LEFT JOIN … ON` referencing an
alias introduced later in the same FROM clause (a crash). The
ordinary-`Scan`-in-`core` design renders core scans first, unconditionally —
the hazard is unreachable.

### Soundness: multiplicity

The CTE emits `SELECT DISTINCT sf_s, sf_o` for every kind except bare `!p` at
`PathKind::One` (`UNION ALL`). SPARQL path semantics for `+`/`*`/`?` is a
**set** over endpoint pairs (the ALP algorithm); DISTINCT is exactly that set
at the raw-key level (sound under the node-shape invariant `path.rs` already
enforces). SQL join and SPARQL Join agree on "preserve each operand's own
multiplicity, correlate by equality" — so the set case cannot multiply and the
bag `!p` case (length-1 path ⇒ ordinary triple-pattern bag semantics)
reproduces exactly the right multiplicity. **This argument must be verified
empirically, adversarially** — a duplicate-multiplicity `!p` join fixture
checked against the spareval oracle's own bag counts is a required test, not
an optional one.

### Coverage and remaining sound-501s

Covered: InnerJoin of any arity and mix (incl. two separate paths sharing a
variable); OPTIONAL with a path on either side; EXISTS/NOT EXISTS/MINUS bodies
containing a joined path (falls out of `lower_iq_exists` reusing `lower_node`;
`SqlCond::Exists` CROSS-JOINs scans generically — first `Query`-sourced use,
gets its own test). Stays 501: everything flat-side (by design); a sliced path
as a join operand (inherits the existing SubPlan slice guard — same reason);
GROUP BY over a *joined* path is expected to work via the ordinary single-
branch aggregation path but is **unverified — an open question the
implementation must answer or explicitly gate**.

## Risks (the adversarial-review checklist)

1. **Planner pushdown**: a recursive CTE inside a derived table may not receive
   outer-correlation pushdown (dialect/version-dependent) — a real perf-
   regression risk on large closures joined selectively. Bench before done.
2. **Catalog-blindness** of the embedded SQL (`ColumnCatalog::default()` at
   LOWER time) — a pre-existing, shipped limitation of all derived-table
   rendering, inherited not introduced; recorded, not a blocker.
3. **Raw-SQL validity spike**: two independent `WITH RECURSIVE` blocks, each
   inside its own nested derived table, on both SQLite and PostgreSQL —
   confirm by executing the literal generated SQL, not by assumption.

## Test contract

The pinned boundary test's tree-side assertion deliberately flips to "correct
rows, matching spareval" (flat side stays 501 — the pin's purpose inverts into
documenting the tree-exceeds-flat lift). New differential cells: plain
InnerJoin (PJ_* fixtures exist), OPTIONAL-right-path, OPTIONAL-left-path,
two-separate-paths-joined, EXISTS-with-joined-path-body, the `!p`
duplicate-multiplicity fixture, and the star-at-path-endpoint cell from
`ADR-0032` D6 (which this lift finally makes answerable — update that D6 note
when it lands). `differential_paths`/`differential_tree`/`differential_star`
suites hold throughout; RED-first; adversarial refute-review before commit.
